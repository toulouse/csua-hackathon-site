                        <li><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> <i>We are requiring GitHub submissions this year</i>. Submissions are not required to be either open or closed, but a uniform location for projects will aid the judges in making fair evaluations of the projects.

                                <li>GitHub has excellent <a href="http://help.github.com">tutorials</a> on how to use the version control system Git and how to setup a repository on Github. Source control is a critical piece of the software development workflow.</li>
                                <li>For those who strongly prefer SVN, GitHub does <a href="https://github.com/blog/966-improved-subversion-client-support">offer support</a> for SVN clients. </li>
                                <li>The CSUA is offering a GitHub helpsession on <b>Wednesday from 6PM - 8PM</b> in <b>380 Soda</b>.</li>

"We coded a cool project using Kinect," may be interesting, but will not help the judges identify and recall your project during the judging process.</li>
                        <li>Further details will be released on the day of the event.</li>
