                    <p>Heroku's <a href="http://www.heroku.com/how">platform architecture</a> includes tools for deployment and management, a runtime for scalability, fault tolerance, and an <a href="http://addons.heroku.com/">add-ons</a> system for extending the capabilities of its platform.</p>
                    <p>The San Francisco, CA-based company is a passionate and active supporter of Ruby technologies and cloud architecture. Tens of thousands of developers worldwide have deployed over 100,000+ applications to Heroku.

                        <li><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> <i>We are requiring GitHub submissions this year</i>. Submissions are not required to be either open or closed, but a uniform location for projects will aid the judges in making fair evaluations of the projects.
                            <ul>
                                <li>GitHub has excellent <a href="http://help.github.com">tutorials</a> on how to use the version control system Git and how to setup a repository on Github. Source control is a critical piece of the software development workflow.</li>
                                <li>For those who strongly prefer SVN, GitHub does <a href="https://github.com/blog/966-improved-subversion-client-support">offer support</a> for SVN clients. </li>
                                <li>The CSUA is offering a GitHub helpsession on <b>Wednesday from 6PM - 8PM</b> in <b>380 Soda</b>.</li>
                                <li>Your team will retain all rights to the code you submit. The CSUA makes no claim to ownership or copyright over any of your work. </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>During your final submission, it is <i>very important</i> to write a <b>clear, concise description</b> of your project. "We coded a cool project using Kinect," may be interesting, but will not help the judges identify and recall your project during the judging process.</li>

                                <li>The hackathon is about exploring your awesomeness, independent of what someone else is telling you to do. So be awesome! Learn a new language, do something you haven't done before! Go out on a limb!</li>

                        <li>Creativity will be rewarded: doing new or otherwise interesting things, pushing boundaries, or having a particularly clever take on a common problem will be considered more heavily than implementing something only considered difficult. For example, a conventional physics simulator implementation would not necessarily win to a project with light bikes controlled via the Twilio API.</li>

                        <li>Heroku is an incredibly useful platform for development and rapid deployment, and we highly recommend it. However, its use will not affect judging one way or another, and you should feel free to use whatever platform you please.</li>
                        <li>Completion will be a factor in judging but submissions will not be disqualified for lack of completion.</li>
                        <li>Bugs are okay! You're building a quick hack, not production-quality software!</li>
                        <li>If you make any special claims about the capabilities of your software, please present proof of your claims in your presentation.
                            <ul>
                                <li>The presentation itself doesn't need to be super-high quality - we understand you'll probably be sleep-deprived and not all there. But don't forget to substantiate claims!</li>

                                <li>Fleshing out and preparation work, in general, should be no big deal.</li>
                                <li>If a project does not pass a "smell test", judges may, at their discretion, take this factor into consideration when evaluating the project.</li>
                                <li>It is recommended that a README file be included which explains the necessary disclaimers for pre-work, libraries, etc., and summarizes the work done. However, this is neither required nor scored.</li>

Regardless of whether you are already in the major, still taking the 61 series, or even just thinking about or interested in CS, you're welcome in the CSUA. We are one of the oldest student organizations still active at Berkeley and we serve as one of the primary representatives for student interests to the faculty, department, and outside organizations.</p>
                    <p>Our purpose is to educate the undergraduate computer science student body and other associates and representatives of the University of California at Berkeley, to provide a forum for the academic and social interaction of persons involved in computer science, to promote knowledge in the computer sciences, to shepherd and mentor the next generation of students here at Berkeley, to make the lives of our students richer and more enjoyable, to facilitate student transition into the career world; to provide a forum for current students to interact with alumni, and to raise the funds necessary to accomplish these goals. There is no fee associated with joining the CSUA.</p>
